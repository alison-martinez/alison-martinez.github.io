Mechanical keyboards have been gaining popularity in recent years, and it's not hard to see why. My brother introduced me to the world of mechanical keyboards about a year ago, and I have to say that it's easy to get sucked in to the large range of options that are now available.

When you're getting started with mechanical keyboards, there are three key factors to consider: layout, switches, and premium keycaps.

### Layout

Mechanical keyboards come in different layouts that can affect your typing experience. The most common layout is the full-size keyboard, which includes the numpad on the right side. Compact layouts, such as the tenkeyless (TKL) and 60%, are popular among gamers and those who want more desk space.

The TKL layout removes the numpad, while the 60% layout removes even more keys, including the function row, arrow keys, and some navigation keys. The 65% and 75% layouts are similar to the 60% layout but include arrow keys and some navigation keys.

The 1800 layout is a full-size keyboard with a compact design that removes some of the unused space around the keys. Finally, ergonomic layouts, such as the split and the ortholinear, are designed to reduce hand strain and improve typing comfort.

Overall, the choice of layout depends on your typing needs and personal preferences, and [each layout offers its own advantages and disadvantages](https://next.wooting.io/post/the-ultimate-guide-to-keyboard-layouts-and-form-factors).

### Switches

Mechanical keyboard switches are the heart of any mechanical keyboard, and they come in [different types](https://www.mechanicalkeyboards.com/switches/), each with its own characteristics and feel. The most popular types of switches are Cherry MX switches, which are often used as the gold standard for mechanical keyboards. They come in different colors, including blue, brown, red, and black.

Blue switches are tactile and clicky, with a tactile bump that indicates when the key is activated, and a click sound when the key is pressed. Brown switches are tactile but less clicky, with a similar tactile bump but without the audible click. Red switches are linear and smooth, without the tactile bump or the click, making them ideal for gamers who require fast and quiet typing. Black switches are also linear but have a stiffer spring, making them better suited for heavy typists.

Other types of switches include the Topre switches, which use a capacitive system to register keystrokes and provide a unique typing experience, and the Kailh switches, which are similar to Cherry MX switches but come at a lower price point. Ultimately, the choice of switch depends on your typing style and preferences, and each switch offers a different balance of tactile feedback, actuation force, and noise level.

If you want to learn more, there are a wide range of videos available with a simple search where you can see and hear people typing on every switch type you could possibly think of. You can also by switch samplers that will give you a variety of switches to try out before you commit to buying enough to fill a whole keyboard.

### Keycaps

Keycaps come in different types and profiles, all of which can affect the typing experience. The most common material for keycaps is ABS plastic, which is durable and inexpensive, but can wear down over time. PBT plastic is another popular material, known for its durability and resistance to wear and shine.

Keycaps can also come in different profiles, such as OEM, Cherry, and DSA. OEM keycaps have a slightly curved shape and a larger top surface area, which can provide more comfort for typing. Cherry keycaps have a lower profile and a slight angle, which can improve finger stability and reduce finger fatigue.

DSA keycaps have a uniform profile, with a flat top surface and a cylindrical shape, which can provide a consistent typing experience across all keys. Other keycap profiles include SA, XDA, and KAT. The choice of keycap type and profile depends on your preferences and needs, as each profile can offer different levels of comfort, stability, and aesthetics.

### My Keyboards

With all of that being said, what keyboards am I using right now?

Well, my own personal preference is for a less common layout -- 96%. Specifically, a compact 96% that has no space between any of the keys. My daily driver (above) is an [iQunix F97](https://iqunix.store/collections/f97-series) with Cherry MX brown tactile switches and [UnAlice DSA keycaps from Pimp My Keyboard](https://pimpmykeyboard.com/dsa-unalice-keyset-sublimated/).

Sticking with the theme of compact layout with no space between the keys, two of my other keyboards that I rotate periodically are:

- the [Azio Cascade](https://www.aziocorp.com/collections/cascade-keyboard-collection/products/cascade-75-wireless-hot-swappable-keyboard) 75% wireless hot-swappable keyboard with [Epomaker Pixel Game Keycaps](https://www.amazon.com/EPOMAKER-Sublimation-Mechanical-Keyboard-Structure/dp/B0B3QVJHTX) and Gateron G Pro Brown tactile switches.
- a Vortex Race 3 with clicky Cherry MX Blue switches and [Epomaker Odd Cat XDA Keycaps](https://epomaker.com/collections/keycaps/products/epomaker-odd-cat-keycaps-set), which is my only keyboard without a wireless option.

I know a lot of folks prefer wired keyboards, as there are many attractive coiled keyboard cables available. I personally lean toward wireless keyboards, and the battery life on the IQunix F97 just can't be beat, which may be one of the reasons I keep coming back to it.

I like the Azio Cascade quite a bit, but the battery life is just not great, so I usually end up using it a week or so at a time. The Vortex Race 3 is super-clicky, and I do enjoy that from time to time. Right now I have it at our Maine house so that I have a fun mechanical keyboard on hand even when I'm working away from my home office.

Enjoy exploring the word of mechanical keyboards, but be warned -- it's an expensive and addicting hobby!
