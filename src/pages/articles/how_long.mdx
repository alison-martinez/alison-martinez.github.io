Current and prospective students wonder how long it will take to get through the **Launch School** Core Curriculum. According to the program information, 18+ months is typical, and it can vary depending on whether you complete the Ruby or Javascript track. The Ruby curriculum is longer, as you learn both Ruby and Javascript.

It is important to note that this is not a bootcamp -- you have to master the fundamentals in order to progress to the next course. And when I say master, I mean that any flaws in your assessment(s) must be corrected before moving on. Anything less than an A is just not good enough.

I just finished the _Ruby Track_ and thought it may be helpful to share my experience. I started the Ruby Track in RB101 on March 18, 2022 and finished JS239 on October 10, 2022, so it took me one week shy of **seven months** to complete Core. I have a full-time job, so my Launch School effort was part time. I would say I averaged 2-3 hours per day. Some days I did much more, but I had about 4 weeks of vacation in here where I did very little.

I did not keep a detailed breakdown of time, so my data is limited to assessment completion dates.

## **Core Curriculum Timeline (3/18/2022 - 10/10/2022 )**

## A few notes:

I did the relatively new project and interview assessments in RB189.

JS239 was by far the longest class for me. There was just so much material that it took me awhile to take the plunge and do the assessments. If you are going for Capstone and have a particular cohort in mind, be sure to leave yourself some extra time for this one.

I hope to join the January 2023 Capstone cohort.
