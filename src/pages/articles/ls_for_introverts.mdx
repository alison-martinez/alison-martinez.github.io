I've always excelled in group environments, but I'm an introvert at heart, and my preference is for independent work and study. As an introvert, being part of an educational program that emphasizes group study can be challenging. While some people thrive in group environments, introverts may find it challenging to find their place. However, being an introvert does not mean you cannot excel in an active learning environment like Launch School. With a few key strategies, you can not only survive but thrive throughout the curriculum.

1. **Set Clear Goals**: Before starting any course, it is important to set clear goals. Define what you want to achieve by the end of the course, and break it down into smaller, achievable milestones, whether that be a particular lesson, number of exercises, or number of study hours. This will help you stay focused and motivated throughout the course.

2. **Create a Study Schedule**: Develop a study schedule that works for you. Allocate specific times for studying and stick to them. Make sure to include breaks and time for other activities to avoid burnout. I went through the Core Curriculum while working full-time, and this is totally do-able if you make sure to budget time to study and don't overdo it.

3. **Focus on Fundamentals**: Launch School emphasizes mastery of fundamentals. Take the time to understand the underlying concepts thoroughly. Resist the temptation to move on to more advanced topics or think about future courses without a solid foundation.

4. **Practice, Practice, Practice**: Launch School courses require a lot of hands-on practice. Spend time practicing coding problems, writing code, and testing your solutions. My strategy for a new course was to go through the material once, not focusing on mastery but just trying to get a lay of the land. Then, I would go through a second time and go through all of the exercises, reviewing the solutions along the way. Finally, I would go through a third time and see if I could do all of the exercises without looking at the solutions. When I could do that, I knew I was ready for the assessment. The more you practice, the better you will become.

5. **Seek Feedback**: Launch School provides regular feedback on your progress through assessments and optional code reviews. Make sure to use this feedback to improve your skills and understanding. As an introvert, I personally did not find group study sessions to be helpful or appealing. However, asking questions and reviewing previous students' discussions on the Slack channels can be extremely useful.

6. **Stay Engaged**: Stay engaged with the course materials by taking notes. Some students prefer to take notes just on key takeaways. I preferred to take notes on virtually the entire curriculum in [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), which gives you virtually unlimited options to organize your thinking and reference key concepts quickly. Check the forums for suggestions from other students on their favorite note-taking platforms. Having an effective note-taking strategy will help you stay focused and retain the information.

7. **Stay on the Path**: I have had several students reach out to me for advice on how I moved through the curriculum so quickly. My main piece of advice is focus on the material and don't let yourself get distracted by "side quests" or seeking out additional information. Sure, it can be tempting to explore more advanced topics, but trust me -- those topics will come up later. Trying to understand them before you're ready will not serve you well if your goal is to master the material as quickly as possible. My mantra: if there's not a practice problem or exercise focusing on a particular topic, it's not going to be on the assessment!

8. **Practice Assessments in Real Time**: The SPOT Wiki is rife with example problems and practice tests. Find them and take them. And **time yourself**! Assessments are timed, and you need to be sure that you can answer the questions quickly and thoroughly. Each assessment tells you approximately how many questions there will be and how much time you will have. I kept a timer active while studying to make sure I was moving quickly enough. If you're going to have up to eight minutes per question during the assessment, I would try to make sure that I could thoroughly answer each practice question in five minutes, leaving sufficient time for review and tougher-than-expected questions. I would also keep that timer running during assessments to make sure that I was on track.

Between an undergraduate degree and a PhD, I have gone through numerous exams and courses in my life. But I can say that the Launch School assessments were among the most challenging I have faced. Not because the material was overly difficult, but because the curriculum demands complete mastery, and there is nowhere to hide. However, if you can follow the steps above and are focused on pursuing a career in software engineering, then it can be done, even if you choose to do it solo!
