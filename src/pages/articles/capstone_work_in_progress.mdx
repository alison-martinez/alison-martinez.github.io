At the end of 2022, I quit my stable job at Penn State and set off on a new adventure.

I joined Launch School's first 2023 Capstone cohort for an intensive deep dive into topics that complement the fundamentals mastered in the robust Core Curriculum. The program kicked off with an intensive deep dive into Data Structures and Algorithms, System Design, React, and ultimately a significant group project focused on addressing an important problem domain in the software engineering space.

At this moment, our group (go Team 4!) is in the process of evaluating problem domains and determining what our Capstone project will look like.

Keep an eye on my page to see what we come up with -- I think it's going to be great!
