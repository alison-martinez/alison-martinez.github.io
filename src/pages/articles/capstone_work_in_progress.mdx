As the year 2022 came to a close, I took a big leap into the unknown and said goodbye to my stable job in Penn State's Office of Technology Management. Earlier in the year, I decided I wanted to further my knowledge and skills in software engineering and formally pursue a career that was better matched to my talents and interests. That's when I stumbled upon Launch School's mastery-based program, and I knew this was my chance to take the next step.

Launch School's Core Curriculum is a self-paced, mastery-based intensive program builds strong, fundamental skills that are critical to making a formal transition to software engineering. For those that are looking for even more experience and knowledge, the optional Capstone program builds upon the fundamentals mastered in Launch School's Core Curriculum. It's designed to provide a deep dive into new topics, introducing just-in-time learning and culminating with a group project aimed at addressing a significant problem in the software engineering space.

As a member of the first 2023 Capstone cohort, I was thrilled to embark on this journey with a group of like-minded individuals who were also seeking to push their boundaries. The program started with an intense introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms, System Design, and React. It was a steep learning curve, but with the help of our instructors and peers, I was able to grasp the concepts quickly.

At the moment, my team (go Team 4!) is in the process of evaluating problem domains and deciding what our Capstone project will look like. The project is a significant part of the program and provides us with the opportunity to apply what we have learned and contribute to the software engineering community.

I'm excited to see what the future holds for my team and me. The journey through the Core Curriculum and Capstone Program has been challenging, but it has also been a time of self-discovery and growth. I'm confident that the skills and knowledge I have gained through this program will complement my previous education and experience and support a successful transition to pure software engineering opportunities.

Stay tuned to this page to see what we come up with in the Capstone Program. I have a feeling that it's going to be great!
