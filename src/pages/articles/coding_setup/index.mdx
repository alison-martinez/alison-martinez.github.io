Having an aesthetically pleasing work environment helps to keep me engaged and productive. I've cycled through a range of fonts and themes in search of the perfect coding setup, and I'm pretty happy with what I'm using right now.

## VS Code

<Image src={vsCodeStyle} alt="" />
There are a number of excellent themes available for VS Code, but my current favorite
is [Poimandres](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pmndrs.pmndrs),
which has a clean appearance and a soothing color palette.

A great font is key to the coding experience, and it's tough to beat [Dank Mono](https://philpl.gumroad.com/l/dank-mono). It's a paid font, but well worth the $28 license fee. The ligatures and italic styles are gorgeous, and I've customized my VS Code settings to maximize the appearance of the italic variant throughout my code:

```json
"editor.tokenColorCustomizations": {
    "[poimandres]": {
      "textMateRules": [
        {
          "scope": "emphasis",
          "settings": {
            "fontStyle": "italic"
          }
        },
        {
          "scope": "strong",
          "settings": {
            "fontStyle": "bold"
          }
        },
        {
          "scope": "entity.other.attribute-name",
          "settings": {
            "fontStyle": "italic"
          }
        },
        {
          "scope": "markup.underline",
          "settings": {
            "fontStyle": "underline"
          }
        },
        {
          "scope": "markup.bold",
          "settings": {
            "fontStyle": "bold"
          }
        },
        {
          "scope": "markup.heading",
          "settings": {
            "fontStyle": "bold"
          }
        },
        {
          "scope": "markup.italic",
          "settings": {
            "fontStyle": "italic"
          }
        },
        {
          "scope": "storage.type",
          "settings": {
            "fontStyle": "italic"
          }
        },
        {
          "scope": "storage.modifier",
          "settings": {
            "fontStyle": "italic"
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "String interpolation",
          "scope": [
            "punctuation.definition.template-expression.begin",
            "punctuation.definition.template-expression.end",
            "punctuation.section.embedded"
          ],
          "settings": {
            "fontStyle": "italic"
          }
        },
        {
          "scope": "keyword.control",
          "settings": {
            "fontStyle": "italic"
          }
        },
        {
          "scope": [
            "keyword.operator.new",
            "keyword.operator.expression",
            "keyword.operator.cast",
            "keyword.operator.sizeof",
            "keyword.operator.logical.python"
          ],
          "settings": {
            "fontStyle": "italic"
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "this.self",
          "scope": "variable.language",
          "settings": {
            "fontStyle": "italic",
            "foreground": "#ff5874"
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "@Decorator",
          "scope": ["meta.decorator punctuation.decorator"],
          "settings": {
            "fontStyle": "italic"
          }
        },
        {
          "scope": ["punctuation.definition.comment", "comment"],
          "settings": {
            // "foreground": "#ff5874",
            "fontStyle": "italic"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  },

```

Finally, the [Material Icons VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme) adds an attractive icon in front of every file, which makes it easier to visually scan the file tree.

## Terminal

<Image src={terminalStyle} alt="" />

My Linux terminal deserves some love, too, and I use [Powerline-go](https://github.com/justjanne/powerline-go), a Powerline-like prompt for Bash.
It shows key details about your current path and git branch, and it's easy to customize and extend.

I recommend using a font that has support for all of the extra icons and symbols to get the full effect. My favorite is [Nerdfont FiraCode Mono](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads), and don't forget to add it to your VS Code integrated terminal, too!

As a final touch, I updated my `ls` command to [logo-ls](https://github.com/yash-handa/logo-ls), a version of `ls` that shows file icons. I don't know about you, but I'm ready to code!
